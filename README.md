# Advent of Code 2023

My submissions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). I will be primarily using JS for these problems.

## Requirements

- node 20.10.0

## How to use

You can run any of the day's problems by using the following code. To select the day and problem replace the first and second parameter.

```javascript
// day 1 problem 1
npm run start -- 1 1

// day 3 problem 2
npm run start -- 3 2
```
